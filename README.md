Overview

This project demonstrates how Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can be applied to inventory control problems in supply chain management.

We investigate three fundamental settings:

Single-echelon inventory systems

Serial supply chain systems

Networked (multi-node) supply chains

Our goal is to infer reward functions and optimal policies from expert behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making in complex inventory environments.
